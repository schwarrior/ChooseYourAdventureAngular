# Project Overview

A simple choose-your-own adventure story, implemented as several different types of web apps, including Angular.

This project seeks to show, with progressive app iterations, the benefits and costs incurred as new technology is added to the app stack. 

The last two iterations use Angular 21. 

With the final app iteration, the app becomes an engine to present a choose-your-own-adventure story with any content or forking structure.
